  fields:
    bicycle_network:
      description: |
          From 1 for international network to 4 for local.
    bicycle_name:
      description: |
          Name of the major network.
    bicycle_ref:
      description: |
          Ref of the major network.
    hiking_network:
      description: |
          From 1 for international network to 4 for local.
    hiking_name:
      description: |
          Name of the major network.
    hiking_ref:
      description: |
          Ref of the major network.
    hiking_ascent:
      description: |
          The ascent covered by a route (default units are metres; specify others explicitly). If a route has start and end point at different altitude use descent too. 
    hiking_descent:
      description: |
          The descent covered by a route (default units are metres; specify others explicitly). Use it only if it differs from the ascent (different altitude at start/endpoint of a route). 
    hiking_distance:
      description: |
          The nominal distance covered by the route. For users' information and automatic evaluation; e.g., of completeness. The default unit is km. Use dot as decimal separator. If a unit is specified, it should be separated from the number by a space and use a value as described on the Units page. 
    hiking_website:
      description: |
          optional Website.
